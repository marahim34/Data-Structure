Level Order Traversal
Level order traversal is a way of visiting every node in a tree by examining each level of the tree one at a time. It starts from the root node and moves level by level, from top to bottom, and from left to right within each level. This traversal method is also known as breadth-first traversal because it explores the breadth (width) of the tree before going deeper into the next level.

How Does It Work?
Start from the Root (Level 0):

The traversal begins at the root node, which is the topmost node in the tree. This node is considered to be at level 0.

Visit Nodes Level by Level:
After processing the root, you move on to the next level (level 1). At each level, you visit all nodes before moving on to the next deeper level.

Left to Right Within Each Level:
While processing nodes at a particular level, the nodes are visited from left to right. So, if a node has a left child and a right child, the left child is processed before the right child.

Example:
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \   \
    4   5   6

Level 0: Start with the root node, which is 1.
Level 1: Move to the next level and visit nodes 2 and 3.
Level 2: Finally, move to the last level and visit nodes 4, 5, and 6.
So, the level order traversal of this tree would produce the sequence: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

Implementation Details:
To implement level order traversal, we use a queue data structure. A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure, which means elements added first are removed first. This characteristic makes it perfect for level order traversal.

Steps to Implement:
Initialize a Queue:

Start by placing the root node in the queue.
While the Queue is Not Empty:

Remove the Front Node: Take the node at the front of the queue and process it (e.g., print its value).
Enqueue the Node’s Children: If the current node has a left child, add it to the queue first, then add the right child.

This process ensures that all nodes are visited level by level.
