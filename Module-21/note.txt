Binary Search Tree (BST)
- BST stands for Binary Search Tree.

- It combines the concepts of a Binary Tree and Binary Search.

- A BST is a type of binary tree where you can efficiently perform binary search operations.

- In an array, binary search requires the array to be sorted beforehand. However, in a BST, the tree itself is organized in a way that maintains this order without needing an external sorting step.

- To maintain this structure, a BST must follow these two key rules:
    - The values in the left subtree (node->left) must be smaller than the value of the current node.
    - The values in the right subtree (node->right) must be greater than the value of the current node.

These rules ensure that the tree remains sorted, allowing for quick searches, insertions, and deletions.
